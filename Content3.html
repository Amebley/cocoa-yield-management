                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-700">Choosing and Preparing the Plantation Site</h1>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Choosing the Site</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">For cocoa trees to thrive, they need:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li>A soil of good structure</li>
                    <li>Permeable and deep soil</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">The cocoa tree has tap-roots that descend straight into the soil, with branch roots going deep and many small branch roots near the surface. Good soil structure and humus content help the roots penetrate well. Improve soil by spreading manure and working it in. Avoid planting in stony soil or where there is a hard layer.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Clearing the Site</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">In Africa, cocoa is grown in forest regions. The site must be cleared to make way for the plantation. Cocoa trees need shade, especially when young. Traditional methods of clearing, such as cutting down all trees and burning, are harmful as they destroy organic matter, expose soil to erosion, and reduce fertility.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Instead, clear tall weeds, creepers, and small trees first. Arrange the cuttings in heaps and leave them on the ground to protect the soil and add humus. If burning is necessary, sow a cover crop afterward. Remove trees that may cause disease or give too much shade, but leave those providing beneficial shade. Gradually reduce the shade as cocoa trees mature.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In some regions like Cameroon and Ivory Coast, certain trees are removed while others are left to provide shade. Refer to the specific trees listed for each region.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Preparing to Plant Cocoa Trees</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Planting cocoa trees should be done systematically, not haphazardly. Plant in rows with about 2.5 to 3 meters between rows and trees. This allows for approximately 1,000 to 1,600 seedlings per hectare. Dig planting holes two months in advance and separate the soil from the top and bottom layers.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Planting Cocoa Trees</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">It is preferable to use seedlings from your nursery or purchased from a research center rather than sowing seeds directly in the plantation. Water the soil a few hours before lifting seedlings to avoid breaking the roots. Sort the seedlings, discarding diseased or twisted ones, and dip roots in liquid mud for easier rooting.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Plant cocoa trees at the start of the rainy season on a moist, cloudy day. Prepare the holes by filling them with topsoil and mixing in manure. Place the seedling in a hole, ensuring the tap-root is not twisted. Do not cover the crown with earth. Pack the soil around the tap-root and protect the seedling from the sun initially.</p>
