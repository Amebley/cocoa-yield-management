                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-700">Cocoa Tree and Varieties</h1>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Cocoa Is Grown on Trees</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">The cocoa tree bears fruit on its trunk and branches, known as pods. The pods contain seeds called cocoa beans, which are made up of a seed coat, a kernel, and a germ. Cocoa trees require a high temperature, plenty of water, and consistently moist air. Therefore, cocoa is grown in the hot and humid regions of Africa (mainly in forest regions), Central and South America, Asia, and Oceania.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Varieties of Cocoa Can Be Grown in Africa?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Three main varieties of cocoa are grown in Africa:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Criollo:</strong> When ripe, Criollo pods are long, yellow or red, with deep furrows and big warts. This variety does not produce as much as the others but yields cocoa of very good quality. It is mainly grown in America.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forastero (Amelonado):</strong> The pods are short, yellow, smooth without warts, with shallow furrows. This variety produces well but has lower quality compared to Criollo. It is widely grown in Africa.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trinitario:</strong> This variety is a cross between Criollo and Forastero. The pods are long or short, red and yellow, and it yields cocoa of fairly good quality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Cocoa Is Grown</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">People grow cocoa trees to sell the cocoa beans contained in the pods. The kernel of the cocoa beans is used to make cocoa and chocolate. In Europe and North America, people consume a lot of cocoa and chocolate, but the cocoa tree does not grow in these regions; they buy cocoa from Africa.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">African countries earn significant revenue by selling cocoa, which helps them build schools, dispensaries, roads, and modernize their infrastructure. For Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon, cocoa is an important export crop.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">To maximize revenue, these countries must sell high-quality cocoa. Poor marketing quality, badly harvested, fermented, and dried cocoa fetches lower prices. Proper harvesting, fermentation, and drying enhance cocoa quality and price. To achieve this, growers must:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Choose and grow seeds and seedlings carefully.</li>
                    <li>Select and prepare a good site for the plantation.</li>
                    <li>Continuously maintain the plantation.</li>
                    <li>Harvest pods and prepare beans properly.</li>
                </ul>
